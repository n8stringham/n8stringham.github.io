# a bit about me

Hey, my name is Nate!
I'm a PhD student in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah, advised by [Ellen Riloff](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/). I'm broadly interested in the intersection of NLP and machine learning.

Previously, I graduated from [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/) where I did research with [Mike Izbicki](https://izbicki.me/). Outside of school I was a distance runner and captain for the [Cross Country](https://www.sagehens.com/sports/mxc/index) and [Track and Field](https://www.sagehens.com/sports/mtrack/index) teams.
In my free time you can find me exploring the [Wasatch Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range).

You can contact me at nates [at] cs [dot] utah [dot] edu
